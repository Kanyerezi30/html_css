    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML in full is hypertext markup language</p>
    <p>Index.html is ever your home page</p>
    <p>html is whitespace collapsing</p>
    <h2>Dummy text</h2>
    <p>This is more important when you don't have the information readily available. See below</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ducimus quae veniam nesciunt necessitatibus reiciendis mollitia facilis ab, quos provident. Eius, harum itaque necessitatibus impedit corrupti excepturi fugit quis maxime aperiam.</p>
    <p>You can also control how much text you want</p>
    <h2>Working with images</h2>
    <p>The first thing to do is to get the image. Remember to note where your image is located on your machine</p>
    <p>The image element is a self closing element. Within the image element, we have the source and alternative sections which refer to location/path on your machine and what to be displayed in absence of your image respectively</p>
    <h3>Example</h3><img src="./udemy.png" alt="Image of udemy">
